          <article>
            The ocean is a beautiful place, filled with creatures that swim
            among the waves. As the planet is covered in almost 80% water you
            would assume we would be curious as to what type of creature
            inhabits it, but only 5% of the ocean is explored and charted. The
            reason we don't explore our oceans is because the immense pressure
            in the deep ocean that makes it extremely difficult to explore,
            since that environment makes it extremely dangerous for us.
