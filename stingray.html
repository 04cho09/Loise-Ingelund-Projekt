        <h3>Blue spotted stingray</h3>
        <p>
          The taeniura lymma, is a part of the Dasyatidae family since it has
          pectoral fin discs in oval or diamond like shapeswhich is a common
          characteristic in that species. The blue spotted ray can be found in
          depths of 30m and mostly in the tropical Indian and western Pacific
          Oceans in nearshore, coral reef-associated habitats since they thrive
          in tropical environments. The recroduse in a aplacental viviparous
          way, which is a form of reproduction between egg-laying oviparous (egg
          laying) and live-bearing viviparous(mammals) reproduction.

        <h3>Spotted Eagle ray</h3>
        <p>
          The spotted ray is a cartilaginous fish of the eagle ray family, which
          means their skeletons mainly consist of cartilage. Like many
          stingrays, the spotted ray can be found in many tropical environments
          such as the Atlantic, including the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. They
          can be identified by their dark surface covered in white spots or
          rings, they also have a relatively long tail, just behind the pelvic
          fins that are several venomous. Their diet mainly consists of small
          fish or small crustaceans, and as the blue spotted ray they also
          reproduce in a placental viviparous way. They are also a protected
          species in the great barrier reef as they are considered near
          threatened on the IUCN Red list.

          Fun fact, because their venom usually wasn't deadly dentist in ancient
          Greece actually used to extracted venom from their spines for the
          purpose of being used as an anesthetic.
