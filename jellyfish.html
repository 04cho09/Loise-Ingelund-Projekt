          <h3>bioluminescent jellyfish</h3>
          <p>
            Bioluminescent jellyfish get their name from the light produced by
            the chemical process of the organism. They mainly dwell deep below
            ocean levels where the sun cannot penetrate the sea, which gives
            them their luminescent properties. Jellyfishes in general aren't
            alway luminescent but in those extreme depths where light doesn't
            reach, a chemical process using light-emitting molecules and enzymes
            then causes the jelly fish to light up. They mostly use their light
            as a way to communicate or to distract predators.

          <h3>The Firework Jelly fish - Halitrephes maasi</h3>
          <p>
            Halitrephes maasi, commonly known as the firework jellyfish due to
            their colorful tendons, are a part of the Halicreatidae family. They
            are a part of the deep sea species called hydrozoan as they are
            mostly found at depths between 1 200-1 500 meters. Not much is known
            about the species but what we do know is that they can be found in
            both temperate and tropical waters and they've been found in the
            Antarctic, almost the entire Pacific , Mediterranean and the
            Atlantic.

          Fun fact, jelly fishes are actually one of the oldes multi-organ
          animals in the world.
