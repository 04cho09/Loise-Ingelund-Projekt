              <h3>Blue whales</h3>
              <p>
                Blue whales are the largest species on our planet, their diet mostly consists of krill and a huge volume of ocean water. They can be found in the entire ocean except the arctic ocean, because they migrate during the summer to seasonal feeding ground and later to winter breeding grounds. Their protective status comes from the dangers of entanglement in fishing gear and vessel strikes are to them.

                <h3>The killer whales</h3>
                <p>
                  The killer whales, commonly known as orcas are a part of the Delphinidae family (dolphins) and they are the biggest species in the family. They are also one of the best recognizable mammals with their black and white bodys.Ocas are also the oceans top predator whilst they are predators, they do not kill humans. While they are currently endangered due to overfishing and loss of habitat, the amount of prey they can eat decreased.
Their habitat consists of both open and coastal waters since they have a very varied diet, that means they dwell mostly anywhere food is. The reproduction cycle of orcas are polyamorous, since they have have multiple partners. The female orca has around four estrous periods, in which she is fertile.
