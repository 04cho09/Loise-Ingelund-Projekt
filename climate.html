          <h2>The Climate</h2>
          <p>
            The climate with today's emission of greenhouse gases is more
            unpredictable, as the ocean is getting hotter and the ocean has
            become more acidic because of it. The increased levels of
            atmospheric carbon dioxide over the past few decades could threaten
            the biodiversity and productivity of ocean ecosystems due to the
            higher acidity affecting the balance of minerals in the water, and
            that could make it difficult for certain marine animals to build
            their protective skeletons or shells.

            Not such a fun fact, a further 15-25cm of sea level is expected to
            rise by 2050.
